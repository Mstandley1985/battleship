#DTR: Define the Relationship#

**What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?**
To create an interactive game that includes tests along with a class file with methods that support them. We're driven by an eagerness to learn.

**What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?** 
Our collaboration style is ping-pong style. We'll both contribute in equal parts. Pair programming will allow us to have a better comprehension of our program and the inner workings of it. We are anti divide-and-conquer approach.

**How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?**
We are both direct and honest communicators which we believe will serve us well as we work through this project together. Luckily, we are similiar in that we give and receive direct and honest communication well. 

**How would you describe your work style?**
We are both hard workers and are looking forward to staying diligent in completing the task at hand. 

**What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?**
Sarah is great at asking pointed questions early and often to work through hurdles. Mitch is great at putting in the time and utilizing google research to assist in learning. We will complement each other through playing off of our individual strengths to make a stronger pair.

**What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?**
In previous projects, a strong start to assignments helps to allow more time for comprehension. 

**How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?**
We are great at communicating and setting clear goals as a team. We collaborate well together and are able to make decisions quickly.

**How will we overcome obstacles?**
With our direct and honest communication as well as our ability to reach out beyond the scope of our group for clarity if necessary. 

**What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?**
Periods of focused activity mixed with the appropriate amount of poms and agreed upon breaks to allow our brains to absorb what we're working on. 

**What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?**
None. We'll communicate scheduling preferences as necessary.

**What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?**
Constructive criticism mixed with positive feedback. 

**What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) (as a team) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?**
We are great at reaching out for help early and often and utilizing online resources as we are relatively* inexperienced coders. We are working on learning the interactive phase of writing a program. Mitch and I are at a similar level so I think we will help support each other in the learning process. The Turing team can help support us on improving these skills by continuing to answer our questions and pointing us in the right direction for success.

**What tools do you want to use to manage the project?**
We will utilize google and past projects and assignments we've done in class as a tool to help manage the project.

**How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?**
We will brainstorm together, utilize google, cohort mates, tutor, and mentors to help us through obstacles.

**How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?**
We'll know it is successful when both the journey and the outcome are teaching us to be better coders. We will achieve this as a group through overcoming hurdles together. 

**How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?**
By taking small bitesize chunks and celebrating small wins as we move along through the project. High fives!

#Any additional questions that you would like to add:#

**Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine**
**What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)**
**When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?**
**If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.**
**omodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?**
**Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?**
